# x16tutorial
A self-made tutorial for anyone who wants to learn how to use the x16 from scratch

Please, take into account that this is a WIP and may remain in that status for a long time. Besides, the X16 may hit the market before I end this. Also, that it will keep on growing and adding more content as I keep on learning new stuff.
Basically, this is a compilation about my journey learning to code on the X16 without any previous C64 (or retro computers, as a matter to fact) knowledge.

Wanna know more about the X16? Check out https://www.commanderx16.com/ and take a look around!

Feel free to browse the repo and see the material on your own, or visit the [wiki](https://github.com/sebassco-dp/x16tutorial/wiki) and check out the content I am laying up there.


**DISCLAIMER:** I do not take part in any of the efforts around creating and building the X16. In any case, I am just someone interested in the project who wants to seize the opportunity of learning and documenting the process for others like me :)
